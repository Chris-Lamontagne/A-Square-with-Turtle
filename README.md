# A-Square-with-Turtle
One of the first Turtle projects I did was this one from geeksforgeeks.org where you can input a size and Turtle will draw a square that size on the canvass. It is simple but I thought it was fun learning how to set up the Turtle to move how you want. In this case using a loop to draw four lines with a ninety degree turn at the end.
